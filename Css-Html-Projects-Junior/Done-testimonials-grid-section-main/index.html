I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
